2. **Micronutrient Boost**: Include more colorful vegetables (e.g., bell peppers, carrots, or sweet potatoes) for a broader range of vitamins and minerals.

3. **Fiber Increase**: Incorporate more leafy greens or whole grains, like brown rice or barley, to enhance fiber content.

4. **Healthy Fat Variation**: Use flaxseeds or chia seeds in addition to pumpkin seeds to diversify omega-3 fatty acid sources.
