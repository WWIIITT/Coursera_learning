      "Certainly! A neural network is a type of computer program modeled after the way human brains work. It is primarily used in machine learning and artificial intelligence to recognize patterns, make decisions, and predict outcomes based on data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here’s a simple breakdown of how a neural network works:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Neurons**: Just like the human brain has neurons, a neural network has nodes called \"neurons.\" Each neuron receives inputs, processes them, and produces an output.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Layers**: Neurons are organized in layers:\n",
      "   - **Input Layer**: This is where the network receives data (like images, text, or numerical values).\n",
      "   - **Hidden Layers**: These are layers between the input and output layers. They process the inputs in various ways. There can be one or many hidden layers in a network.\n",
      "   - **Output Layer**: This layer gives the final result, such as a classification (e.g., cat or dog) or a prediction (e.g., a stock price).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Weights and Biases**: Each connection between neurons has a weight that determines how much influence one neuron has on another. There are also biases, which are added to the neuron’s input during processing to help the model make better predictions.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Activation Function**: After receiving inputs and applying weights and biases, each neuron passes its output through an activation function. This function decides whether the neuron should \"fire\" (i.e., send a signal to the next layer). Common activation functions include ReLU (rectified linear unit) and Sigmoid.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Training**: Neural networks learn from data through a process called training. During training, the network adjusts its weights and biases based on how accurate its predictions are compared to the actual outcomes. This is often done using a method called backpropagation and an optimization technique like gradient descent.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Inference**: Once trained, the neural network can be used to make predictions on new data.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, neural networks are powerful tools for tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing, and more, leveraging interconnected layers of simple processing units (neurons) to learn from data.\n",

      "Neural networks have a wide range of applications across various fields due to their ability to recognize patterns and learn from data. Here are some common real-world applications:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Image Recognition**: Neural networks are widely used in computer vision applications, such as facial recognition, object detection, and image classification. For example, social media platforms use them to tag people in photos automatically.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: In applications like chatbots, translation services, and sentiment analysis, neural networks can understand and generate human language. For instance, voice assistants like Siri or Alexa use NLP to respond to voice commands.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Autonomous Vehicles**: Self-driving cars utilize neural networks for various tasks, including object detection (recognizing pedestrians, vehicles, traffic signs) and decision-making (navigating and avoiding obstacles).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Medical Diagnosis**: In healthcare, neural networks are used to analyze medical images (like X-rays and MRIs) to detect conditions such as tumors or fractures. They can also assist in predicting patient outcomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Recommendation Systems**: Platforms like Netflix, Amazon, and Spotify use neural networks to analyze user data and preferences to recommend movies, products, or music tailored to individual users.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Financial Services**: In finance, neural networks are employed for fraud detection, credit scoring, and algorithmic trading. They analyze transaction patterns to identify potentially fraudulent activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Gaming**: In the field of gaming, neural networks can be used to develop intelligent non-player characters (NPCs) and even to create games that adapt to players’ skill levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Time Series Prediction**: Neural networks are powerful for predicting future values based on historical data. They are used in stock market predictions, weather forecasting, and demand forecasting in various industries.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Speech Recognition**: Applications like Google Voice Search and transcription services rely on neural networks to convert spoken language into written text.\n",
      "\n",
      "These applications highlight the versatility and power of neural networks across different industries, improving efficiency and enabling innovative solutions.\n",

    "\n",
    "By enabling summary_method=`\"reflection_with_llm\"`, we allow the system to generate a final response that is not simply a direct answer, but a **reflection of a structured conversation** between multiple agents with defined roles.\n",
    "\n",

    "- A **student** asks a clear question,\n",
    "- A **tutor** responds with a beginner-friendly explanation,\n",
    "- And the LLM reflects on this interaction to generate a detailed and coherent summary.\n",

    "This often produces **higher-quality, context-rich answers**, as the reasoning is distributed and clarified through role-based collaboration.  \n",

      "### Explanation of the Code:\n",
      "1. **Import Libraries**: The `numpy` library is imported to handle numerical operations, particularly for generating the range of x values and calculating sine values. The `matplotlib.pyplot` library is imported for plotting.\n",
      "  \n",
      "2. **Define x values**: `np.linspace(-2*np.pi, 2*np.pi, 1000)` generates 1000 evenly spaced values between -2π and 2π.\n",
      "  \n",
      "3. **Calculate y values**: `y = np.sin(x)` computes the sine for each value in x.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Create the Plot**:\n",
      "   - `plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))` initializes a new figure with a specific size.\n",
      "   - `plt.plot(x, y, ...)` draws the sine wave.\n",
      "   - Additional functions like `plt.title()`, `plt.xlabel()`, and `plt.ylabel()` are used to add titles and axis labels.\n",
      "   - `plt.axhline()` and `plt.axvline()` draw horizontal and vertical lines at y=0 and x=0 respectively for better visual reference.\n",
      "   - `plt.grid()` adds a grid to the plot for easier reading.\n",
      "   - `plt.legend()` displays a legend describing the plotted line.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Save the Plot**: `plt.savefig('sine_wave.png')` saves the current figure to a file named `sine_wave.png`.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Close the Plot**: `plt.close()` is used to close the figure and is especially useful in scripts to avoid displaying the plot when executed.\n",
      "\n",
      "After running the script, you should find the file `sine_wave.png` in the same directory.\n",

    "## Agent Orchestration & Multi-Agent Systems in AG2<a name=\"agent-orchestration\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "AG2 enables the coordination of multiple intelligent agents to collaboratively solve complex tasks. This is known as **agent orchestration** — a powerful design pattern where each agent plays a specialized role, and a **group manager** handles the conversation flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Multi-Agent Systems?\n",
    "\n",
    "Many real-world problems require more than just a single AI assistant. With AG2, you can:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Assign specific roles and responsibilities to different agents.\n",
    "- Orchestrate conversations using built-in patterns (for example, Auto, RoundRobin, Manual).\n",
    "- Enable agents to build on each other's outputs and refine ideas.\n",
    "- Incorporate human agents for oversight, decisions, or approval.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Orchestration Patterns in AG2\n",
    "\n",
    "AG2 provides several orchestration patterns to structure agent interactions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Two-Agent Chat**: Simple back-and-forth between two agents.\n",
    "- **Sequential Chat**: Conversations where one agent’s output becomes another’s input.\n",
    "- **Group Chat**: Multiple agents interact, with selection logic for who speaks next.\n",
    "- **Nested Chat**: Reusable sub-conversations packaged as a single workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## GroupChat and GroupChatManager\n",
    "\n",
    "In AG2, multi-agent collaboration is coordinated using `GroupChat` and `GroupChatManager`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### GroupChat\n",
    "\n",
    "`GroupChat` defines a team of agents and how they interact in a shared conversation. It includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Agents**: A list of AI (or human) agents that participate in the group dialogue.\n",
    "- **Speaker Selection Method**: Determines which agent speaks next. Options include:\n",
    "  - `\"auto\"`: Uses the LLM to select the most contextually appropriate agent.\n",
    "  - `\"round_robin\"`: Agents take turns in a fixed sequence.\n",
    "  - `\"manual\"`: Human selects the next speaker.\n",
    "  - `\"random\"`: Agents are chosen randomly.\n",
    "\n",
    "This structure allows you to define collaborative workflows where agents build on each other’s contributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### GroupChatManager\n",
    "\n",
    "`GroupChatManager` is responsible for managing the flow of the group conversation and it:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Orchestrates message passing between agents.\n",
    "- Decides when to stop the conversation (for example, based on a termination condition or turn limit).\n",
    "- Leverages the speaker selection method defined in `GroupChat`.\n",
    "\n",
    "It acts like a facilitator that ensures the conversation runs according to the logic you've configured.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A conversation is initiated by one of the agents (often a user or teacher agent).\n",
    "2. The `GroupChatManager` uses the selected pattern (for example, AutoPattern) to determine which agent speaks next.\n",
    "3. Agents take turns responding based on their roles and system messages.\n",
    "4. The conversation ends either when a stop condition (for example, a message like \"DONE\") is met or when a maximum number of turns is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "This setup enables modular, role-based collaboration — ideal for use cases like lesson planning, research workflows, or multi-perspective decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "To explore more orchestration patterns, visit the AG2 documentation at:  \n",
    "https://docs.ag2.ai/latest/docs/user-guide/advanced-concepts/orchestration/group-chat/introduction/\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Group Chat for Lesson Planning\n",
    "\n",
    "This example shows how a teacher agent collaborates with a planner and a reviewer to create a lesson plan, using AG2’s `GroupChat` and `AutoPattern` to manage the conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** The `is_termination_msg` parameter used for `teacher` agent defines a custom rule to end the conversation —  \n",
    "in this case, the workflow stops when the teacher replies with \"DONE!\".\n"

    "### What is `register_function(...)` ?\n",
    "\n",
    "In AG2, `register_function(...)` is used to expose a Python function as a **tool** that can be executed by one agent on behalf of another. This enables agents to delegate tasks like computation, data processing, or external API calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Purpose\n",
    "- Extend agent capabilities beyond text generation.\n",
    "- Allow agents to solve tasks through **function execution**.\n",
    "- Enable collaborative workflows between a **caller** and an **executor** agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Parameters\n",
    "- **function**: A regular Python function to be used as a tool.\n",
    "- **caller**: The agent that will request the tool to be used.\n",
    "- **executor**: The agent that will actually execute the function.\n",
    "- **description** *(optional)*: A natural language description of the function for the LLM to decide when to use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "```python\n",
    "register_function(\n",
    "    is_prime,\n",
    "    caller=math_asker,\n",
    "    executor=math_checker,\n",

    "Structured outputs ensure consistent, validated agent responses using Pydantic models.   \n",
    "\n",
    "This is crucial for:\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Data validation**: Ensuring response format consistency\n",
    "- **API integration**: Reliable data exchange\n",
    "- **Quality assurance**: Preventing malformed outputs\n",
    "- **Type safety**: Clear data contracts\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analogy:** Like standardized hospital forms ensure doctors always record patient info the same way, structured outputs make sure agents respond in predictable, machine-readable formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In AG2, structured outputs are implemented using Pydantic models and the `response_format` parameter in the `LLMConfig`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure that your agent always returns outputs in a consistent structure, you define a Pydantic class (for example, `ResponseModel`) and assign it to the `response_format` argument of your configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tells the underlying LLM to return a JSON-compatible response matching the defined schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class ResponseModel(BaseModel):\n",
    "    name: str\n",
    "    status: str\n",
    "\n",
    "llm_config = LLMConfig(\n",

    "    model=\"gpt-4o-mini\",\n",
    "    response_format=ResponseModel\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "With this setup:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The agent automatically formats its responses to match the ResponseModel. \n",
    "- You don’t need to prompt the LLM to format its response.\n",
    "- The response is parsed and validated by AG2.\n",

    "- **Specialize agents** for specific tasks rather than creating generalists\n",
    "\n",
    "### HITL implementation\n",
    "- **Use HITL for high-stakes decisions** requiring human judgment\n",
    "- **Implement clear escalation criteria** (amount thresholds, risk levels)\n",
    "- **Provide context** to human supervisors for informed decisions\n",
    "- **Log all human interventions** for audit trails\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multi-agent orchestration\n",
    "- **Design clear workflows** with defined handoffs between agents\n",
    "- **Use GroupChat** for collaborative problem-solving\n",
    "- **Implement termination conditions** to prevent endless conversations\n",
    "- **Monitor conversation quality** and intervention points\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tools and integration\n",
    "- **Create focused tools** for specific capabilities\n",
    "- **Implement proper error handling** in tool functions\n",
    "- **Validate tool inputs** and outputs\n",
    "- **Document tool capabilities** clearly for agents\n",
    "\n",
